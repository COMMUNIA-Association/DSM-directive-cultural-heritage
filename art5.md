## Article 5 Preservation of cultural heritage

1. Member States shall provide for an exception to the rights provided for in Article 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC, Articles 5(a) and 7(1) of Directive 96/9/EC, Article 4(1)(a) of Directive 2009/24/EC and Article 11(1) of this Directive, permitting cultural heritage institutions, to make copies of or digitise any works or other subject-matter that are permanently in their collections, in any format or medium, for the sole purpose of the preservation of such works or other subject-matter, to the extent necessary for such preservation and without modifying the original works beyond the degree necessary for their preservation.

1a. When a cultural heritage institution mandates a third party, including in another Member State, to perform, under its responsibility, an act of reproduction or digitisation for the purposes of the first subparagraph, the exception provided for in the first subparagraph shall be deemed to apply to that act of reproduction or digitisation, provided that all copies of the works or other subject-matter are returned to the requesting cultural heritage institution or deleted.

Any contractual provision contrary to the exception provided for in the first subparagraph shall be unenforceable.
