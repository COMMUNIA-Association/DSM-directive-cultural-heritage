# CHAPTER 1 Out-of-commerce works

## Article 7 Use of out-of-commerce works by cultural heritage institutions

1. Member States shall provide for an exception or limitation to the rights provided for in Articles 2 and 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC, Articles 5(a) and 7(1) of Directive 96/9/EC, Article 4(1) of Directive 2009/24/EC and Article 11(1) of this Directive in order to allow cultural heritage institutions to distribute, communicate to the public or make available out-of-commerce works or other subject-matter permanently in the collection of the institution for non- commercial purposes. Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this paragraph before 22 December 2020. 

    When applying the exception or limitation Member States shall take due account of remuneration schemes to compensate for any unreasonable actions contrary to the legitimate interests of rightholders, and ensure that all rightholders may at any time object to the use of any of their works or other subject-matter that are deemed to be out of commerce and be able to exclude the use of their works or other subject-matter. 

    Acts which would otherwise be permitted under paragraph 1 shall not be permitted if valid extended collective licencing solutions are available authorising the acts in question and the cultural heritage institution responsible for those acts knew or ought to have been aware of that fact. 

    Member States shall provide that when a collective management organisation, on behalf of its members, concludes a non-exclusive licence for non- commercial purposes with a cultural heritage institution for the digitisation, distribution, communication to the public or making available of out-of-commerce works or other subject-matter permanently in the collection of the institution, such a non-exclusive licence may be extended or presumed to apply to rightholders of the same category as those covered by the licence who are not represented by the collective management organisation, provided that:
  
2. A work or other subject-matter shall be deemed to be out of commerce when the whole work or other subject- matter, is not available through customary channels in any form suitable for the work permanently in the collection of a cultural heritage institution. Out of commerce works include both works that have previously been available commercially and works that have never been commercially available.

    Member States shall, in consultation with rightholders, collective management organisations and cultural heritage institutions, ensure that the requirements used to determine whether works and other subject-matter are out of commerce do not extend beyond what is necessary and reasonable and proportionate do not preclude the possibility to determine the out-of-commerce status of a collection as a whole, when it is reasonable to presume that all works or other subject-matter in the collection are out of commerce.

3. Member States shall provide that appropriate publicity measures are taken regarding:

    (a) the deeming of works or other subject-matter as out of commerce;
    
    (b) any licence, and in particular its application to unrepresented rightholders;
    
    (c) the possibility of rightholders to object, referred to in paragraph 2 and point (c) of paragraph 4;

    including during a reasonable period of time before the works or other subject-matter are digitised, distributed, communicated to the public or made available.

4. Member States shall ensure that the licences referred to in paragraph 1 are sought from a collective management organisation that is representative for the Member State where:

    (a) the majority of works or phonograms were first published or, in the absence of publication, where they were first created or broadcast, except for cinematographic and audiovisual works;

    (b) the producers of the works have their headquarters or habitual residence, for cinematographic and audiovisual works; or

    (c) the cultural heritage institution is established, when a Member State or a third country could not be determined, after proven efforts, according to points (a) and (b).

## Article 8 Cross-border uses

1. Works or other subject-matter used in accordance with Article 7 may be used by the cultural heritage institutions in all Member States.

2. Member States shall ensure that information that allows the identification of the works or other subject-matter used in accordance with Article 7 and information about the possibility of rightholders to object referred to in Article 7(2) and (4)(c) are made publicly accessible in a single online portal for at least six months before the works or other subject-matter are digitised, distributed, communicated to the public or made available in all Member States.

3. The portal referred to in paragraph 2 shall be established and managed by the European Union Intellectual Property Office in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 386/2012.

## Article 9 Stakeholder dialogue

Member States shall ensure a regular dialogue between representative users' and rightholders' organisations, and any other relevant stakeholder organisations, to, on a sector-specific basis, foster the relevance and usability of the mechanisms referred to in Article 7, including resolving issues where cultural heritage institutionsâ€™ activities in line with Articles 7 and 8 are not being reasonably enabled, to ensure the effectiveness of the safeguards for rightholders referred to in this Chapter, notably as regards publicity measures, and, where applicable, to assist in the establishment of the requirements referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 7(6).
