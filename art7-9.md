# CHAPTER 1 Out-of-commerce works

## Article 7 Use of out-of-commerce works by cultural heritage institutions

1. Member States shall provide that when a collective management organisation, on behalf of its members, concludes a non-exclusive licence for non-commercial purposes with a cultural heritage institution for the digitisation, distribution, communication to the public or making available of out-of-commerce works or other subject-matter permanently in the collection of the institution, such a non-exclusive licence may be extended or presumed to apply to rightholders of the same category as those covered by the licence who are not represented by the collective management organisation, provided that:

    (a) the collective management organisation is, on the basis of mandates from rightholders, broadly representative of rightholders in the category of works or other subject-matter and of the rights which are the subject of the licence;
    
    (b) equal treatment is guaranteed to all rightholders in relation to the terms of the licence;
    
    (c) all rightholders may at any time object to their works or other subject-matter being deemed to be out of commerce and exclude the application of the licence to their works or other subject-matter.
    
    1a. Member States shall provide for an exception or limitation to the rights provided for in Articles 2 and 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC, Articles 5(a) and 7(1) of Directive 96/9/EC, Article 4(1) of Directive 2009/24/EC, and Article 11(1) of this Directive, permitting cultural heritage institutions to make copies available online of out-of-commerce works that are located permanently in their collections for not-for-profit purposes, provided that:
    
    (a) the name of the author or any other identifiable rightholder is indicated, unless this turns out to be impossible;

    (b) all rightholders may at any time object to their works or other subject- matter being deemed to be out of commerce and exclude the application of the exception to their works or other subject-matter.

    1b. Member States shall provide that the exception adopted pursuant to paragraph 1a does not apply in sectors or for types of works where appropriate licensing-based solutions, including but not limited to solutions provided for in paragraph 1, are available. Member States shall, in consultation with authors, other rightholders, collective management organisations and cultural heritage institutions, determine the availability of extended collective licensing-based solutions for specific sectors or types of works.
  
2. Member States may provide a cut- off date in relation to determining whether a work previously commercialised is deemed to be out of commerce.

    Member States shall, in consultation with rightholders, collective management organisations and cultural heritage institutions, ensure that the requirements used to determine whether works and other subject-matter can be licensed in accordance with paragraph 1 or used in accordance with paragraph 1a do not extend beyond what is necessary and reasonable and do not preclude the possibility to determine the out-of-commerce status of a collection as a whole, when it is reasonable to presume that all works or other subject-matter in the collection are out of commerce.

3. Member States shall provide that appropriate publicity measures are taken regarding:

    (a) the deeming of works or other subject-matter as out of commerce;
    
    (b) any licence, and in particular its application to unrepresented rightholders;
    
    (c) the possibility of rightholders to object, referred to in point (c) of paragraph 1 and point (b) of paragraph 1a;

    including during a period of at least six months before the works or other subject-matter are digitised, distributed, communicated to the public or made available.

4. Member States shall ensure that the licences referred to in paragraph 1 are sought from a collective management organisation that is representative for the Member State where:

    (a) the works or phonograms were first published or, in the absence of publication, where they were first broadcast, except for cinematographic and audiovisual works;

    (b) the producers of the works have their headquarters or habitual residence, for cinematographic and audiovisual works; or

    (c) the cultural heritage institution is established, when a Member State or a third country could not be determined, after reasonable efforts, according to points (a) and (b).

5. Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply to the works or other subject-matter of third country nationals except where points (a) and (b) of paragraph 4 apply.

## Article 8 Cross-border uses

1. Out-of-commerce works or other subject-matter covered by Article 7 may be used by the cultural heritage institution in accordance with that Article in all Member States.

2. Member States shall ensure that information that allows the identification of the works or other subject-matter covered by Article 7 and information about the possibility of rightholders to object referred to in point (c) of Article 7(1) and point (b) of Article 7(1a) are made permanently, easily and effectively accessible in a public single online portal for at least six months before the works or other subject-matter are digitised, distributed, communicated to the public or made available in Member States other than the one where the licence is granted, or in the cases covered by Article 7(1a), where the cultural heritage institution is established and for the whole duration of the licence.

3. The portal referred to in paragraph 2 shall be established and managed by the European Union Intellectual Property Office in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 386/2012.

## Article 9 Stakeholder dialogue

Member States shall ensure a regular dialogue between representative users' and rightholders' organisations, and any other relevant stakeholder organisations, to, on a sector-specific basis, foster the relevance and usability of the licensing mechanisms referred to in Article 7(1) and the exception referred to in Article 7(1a), ensure the effectiveness of the safeguards for rightholders referred to in this Chapter, notably as regards publicity measures, and, where applicable, assist in the establishment of the requirements referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 7(2).
