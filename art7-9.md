# CHAPTER 1 Out-of-commerce works

## Article 7 Use of out-of-commerce works by cultural heritage institutions

1. Member States shall provide for an exception or limitation to the rights provided for in Articles 2 and 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC, Articles 5(a) and 7(1) of Directive 96/9/EC, Article 4(1) of Directive 2009/24/EC, Article 4(1) of Directive 2009/24/EC and Article 11(1) of this Directive in order to allow cultural heritage institutions  to distribute, communicate to the public or make available out-of-commerce works, never in commerce works or other subject-matter permanently in the collection of the institution. Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this paragraph before 22 December 2020.

2. When applying the exception or limitation Member States shall take due account of remuneration schemes to compensate for the prejudice to rightsholders, and ensure that all rightholders may at any time object to their works or other subject-matter being deemed to be out of commerce, never in commerce and exclude the application of the licence to their works or other subject-matter.

3. Acts which would otherwise be permitted by this paragraph  are not permitted if, or to the extent that, reasonable licences from collective management organisations are available authorising the acts in question and the cultural heritage institution  responsible for those acts knew or ought to have been aware of that fact.

4. Member States shall provide that when a collective management organisation, on behalf of its members, concludes a non-exclusive licence for non-commercial purposes with a cultural heritage institution for the distribution, communication to the public or making available of out-of-commerce works, never in commerce works or other subject-matter permanently in the collection of the institution, such a non-exclusive licence may be extended or presumed to apply to rightholders of the same category as those covered by the licence who are not represented by the collective management organisation, provided that:

    (a) the collective management organisation is, on the basis of mandates from rightholders, broadly representative of rightholders in the category of works or other subject-matter and of the rights which are the subject of the licence;
    
    (b) equal treatment is guaranteed to all rightholders in relation to the terms of the licence;
    
    (c) all rightholders may at any time object to their works or other subject-matter being deemed to be out of commerce and exclude the application of the licence to their works or other subject-matter.

5. A work or other subject-matter shall be deemed to be out of commerce when the whole work or other subject-matter  is not available in any form substitutable for the work being distributed, communicated to the public or made available to the public through customary channels of commerce.

    Member States shall, in consultation with rightholders, collective management organisations and cultural heritage institutions, ensure that the requirements used to determine whether works and other subject-matter made available in accordance with paragraph 1 and 3 do not extend beyond what is necessary and reasonable and do not preclude the possibility to determine the out-of-commerce / never in commerce status of a collection as a whole, when it is reasonable to presume that all works or other subject-matter in the collection are out of commerce or never in commerce to begin with.

7. Member States shall provide that appropriate publicity measures are taken regarding:

    (a) the deeming of works or other subject-matter as out of commerce;
    
    (b) the licence, and in particular its application to unrepresented rightholders;
    
    (c) the possibility of rightholders to object, referred to in point (X) of paragraph X;

    including during a reasonable period of time before the works or other subject-matter are digitised, distributed, communicated to the public or made available.

8. Member States shall ensure that the licences referred to in paragraph 1 are sought from a collective management organisation that is representative for the Member State where:

    (a) the majority of  works or phonograms were first created or published or, in the absence of publication, where they were first broadcast, except for cinematographic and audiovisual works;

    (b) the producers of the works have their headquarters or habitual residence, for cinematographic and audiovisual works; or

    (c) the cultural heritage institution is established, when a Member State or a third country could not be determined, after reasonable efforts, according to points (a) and (b).

5. Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply to the works or other subject-matter of third country nationals except where points (a) and (b) of paragraph 4 apply.

## Article 8 Cross-border uses

1. Works or other subject-matter used in accordance with Article 7 may be used by the cultural heritage institution in all Member States.

2. Member States shall ensure that information that allows the identification of the works or other subject-matter used in accordance with Article 7 and information about the possibility of rightholders to object referred to in Article 7(X)(X) are made publicly accessible in a single online portal for at least six months before the works or other subject-matter are digitised, distributed, communicated to the public or made available in all Member States.

3. The portal referred to in paragraph 2 shall be established and managed by the European Union Intellectual Property Office in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 386/2012.

## Article 9 Stakeholder dialogue

Member States shall ensure a regular dialogue between representative users' and rightholders' organisations, and any other relevant stakeholder organisations, to, on a sector-specific basis, foster the relevance and usability of the mechanisms referred to in Article 7 including resolving issues where cultural heritage institutions activities in line with Article 7 are not being reasonably and proportionately enabled, ensure the effectiveness of the safeguards for rightholders referred to in this Chapter, notably as regards publicity measures, and, where applicable, assist in the establishment of the requirements referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 7(6).
