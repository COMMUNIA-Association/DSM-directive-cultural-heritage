# CHAPTER 1 Out-of-commerce works

## Article 7 Use of out-of-commerce works by cultural heritage institutions

1. Member States shall provide that a collective management organisation, in accordance with its mandates, may conclude a non-exclusive licence for non-commercial purposes with a cultural heritage institution for the reproduction, distribution, communication to the public or making available to the public of out-of-commerce works or other subject-matter permanently in the collection of the institution, irrespective of whether all rightholders covered by the licence have mandated the collective management organisation, provided that:

    (a) the collective management organisation is, on the basis of mandates from rightholders, directly affected by the licence or representation agreements based on such mandates, sufficiently representative of rightholders in the relevant type of works or other subject-matter and of the rights which are the subject of the licence;
    
    (b) equal treatment is guaranteed to all rightholders in relation to the terms of the licence.

    1a. Member States shall provide for an exception or limitation to the rights provided for in Articles 2 and 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC, Articles 5(a), (b), (d) and (e) and 7(1) of Directive 96/9/EC, Article 4(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 2009/24/EC, and Article 11(1) of this Directive, in order to allow cultural heritage institutions to make available online copies of out-of- commerce works or other subject-matter that are permanently in their collections for non-commercial purposes, provided that:

    (a) [the author or any other identifiable rightholder was informed individually at least six months before the use, unless this turns out to be impossible, and] the name of the author or any other identifiable rightholder is indicated, unless this turns out to be impossible;
    
    1b. Member States shall provide that the exception or limitation referred to in the previous paragraph only applies to types of works or other subject- matter for which no collective management organisation exists that fulfils the conditions referred to in point (a) of paragraph 1.
    
    1c. Member States shall provide that all rightholders may at any time, easily and effectively, exclude their works or other subject- matter from the licensing mechanism referred to in paragraph 1 or from uses under the exception or limitation referred to in paragraph 1a, either in general or in specific cases, including after the conclusion of a licence or the beginning of the use concerned.

2. A work or other subject-matter shall be deemed to be out-of- commerce when it can be presumed in good faith that the whole work or other subject-matter is not available to the public through customary channels of commerce after a reasonable effort is made to determine such availability.

    Member States may provide for specific requirements to determine whether works and other subject-matter can be licensed in accordance with paragraph 1 or used under the exception or limitation referred to in paragraph 1a. Such requirements shall not extend beyond what is necessary and reasonable, and shall not preclude the possibility to determine the out-of-commerce status of a set of works or other subject-matter as a whole, when it is reasonable to presume that all works or other subject-matter are out-of commerce.

4. Member States shall ensure that the licences referred to in paragraph 1 are sought from a collective management organisation that is representative in the sense of point (a) of paragraph 1.

5. This Article shall not apply to sets of out-of- commerce if, on the basis of the reasonable effort referred to in paragraph 2, there is evidence that such sets predominantly consist of:

    (a) works or other subject-matter first published or, in the absence of publication, first broadcast in a third country, except for cinematographic or audiovisual works;
    
    (b) cinematographic or audiovisual works, the producers of which have their headquarters or habitual residence in a third country; or
    
    (c) works or other subject-matter of third country nationals when a Member State or a third country could not be determined, after a reasonable effort, according to points (a) and (b);
    
    unless the collective management organisation issuing licences according to paragraph 1 is sufficiently representative of rightholders of that third country in the meaning of point (a) of paragraph 1.

## Article 8 Cross-border uses

1. A licence granted in accordance with Article 7 may allow the use of out- of-commerce works or other subject-matter by the cultural heritage institution in any Member State.

2. [The uses of works and other subject-matter under the exception or limitation referred to in Article 7(1a) shall be deemed to occur solely in the Member State where the cultural heritage institution undertaking that use is established.]

## Article 8a Publicity measures

1. Member States shall ensure that information from cultural heritage institutions, collective management organisations or relevant public authorities for the purposes of the identification of the out-of-commerce works or other subject-matter covered by a licence granted in accordance with Article 7(1) or used under the exception or limitation referred to in Article 7(1a) as well as information about the possibilities of rightholders referred to in Article 7(1c), and, as soon as it is available and where relevant, information on the parties to the licence, the covered territories outside of the single market and the allowed uses is made permanently, easily and effectively accessible in a public single online portal from at least six months before the works or other subject-matter are distributed, communicated to the public or made available to the public in accordance with the licence or under the exception or limitation.

    The portal shall be established and managed by the European Union Intellectual Property Office in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 386/2012.
    
2. Member States shall provide that, if necessary for the general awareness of rightholders, further appropriate publicity measures are taken regarding the possibility for collective management organisations to license works or other subject-matter in accordance with Article 7, the licences granted, the uses under the exception or limitation referred to in Article 7(1a) and the possibilities of rightholders referred to in Article 7(1c).

    The additional appropriate publicity measures shall be taken in the Member State where the licence is sought in accordance to Article 7(1) or, for uses under the exception or limitation referred to in Article 7(1a), where the cultural heritage institution is established. If there is evidence, such as the origin of the works or other subject-matter, to suggest that the awareness of rightholders could be more efficiently raised in other Member States or third countries, such publicity measures shall also cover those Member States and third countries.

## Article 9 Stakeholder dialogue

Member States shall consult rightholders, collective management organisations and cultural heritage institutions in each sector before establishing specific requirements pursuant to Article 7(2), and encourage a regular dialogue between representative users' and rightholders' organisations, including collective management organisations, and any other relevant stakeholder organisations, on a sector-specific basis, to foster the relevance and usability of the licensing mechanisms referred to in Article 7(1) and to ensure the effectiveness of the safeguards for rightholders referred to in this Chapter.
