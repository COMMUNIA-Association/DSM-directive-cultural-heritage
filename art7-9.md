## Article 2 Definitions

(4) 'Out of commerce work' means a work or other subject-matter that is not available to the public through customary channels of commerce in all its versions and cannot be reasonably expected to become so in all its versions. Out of commerce works include both works that have previously been available commercially and works that have never been commercially available.

# CHAPTER 1 Out-of-commerce works

## Article 7 Use of out-of-commerce works by cultural heritage institutions

1. Member States shall provide that when a collective management organisation, on behalf of its members, concludes a non-exclusive licence for non-commercial purposes with a cultural heritage institution for the distribution, communication to the public or making available of out-of-commerce works or other subject-matter permanently in the collection of the institution, such a non-exclusive licence may be extended or presumed to apply to rightholders of the same category as those covered by the licence who are not represented by the collective management organisation, provided that:

	(a) the collective management organisation is, on the basis of mandates from rightholders, broadly representative of rightholders in the category of works or other subject-matter and of the rights which are the subject of the licence;

	(b) equal treatment is guaranteed to all rightholders in relation to the terms of the licence;

2. Member States shall provide for an exception to the rights provided for in Article 2 and 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC, Articles 5(a) and 7(1) of Directive 96/9/EC, Article 4(1) of Directive 2009/24/EC, and Article 11(1) of this Directive, permitting cultural heritage institutions, to make copies of Out of Commerce Works that are permanently located in their collections available online on their own online services for non-commercial purposes, provided that the name of the author or any other identifiable rightholder is indicated, unless this turns out to be impossible.

3. Member States shall provide that the exception adopted pursuant to paragraph 2 does not apply in sectors or for types of works where appropriate licensing based solutions including but not limited to solutions provided for paragraph 1 are available or can be expected to become available. Member states shall, in consultation with authors, other rightholders, collective management organisations and cultural heritage institutions, determine the availability of licensing based solutions for specific sectors or types of works.

4. Member States shall, in consultation with rightholders, collective management organisations and cultural heritage institutions, ensure that the requirements used to determine whether works and other subject-matter can be licensed in accordance with paragraph 1 or used in accordance with paragraph 2 do not extend beyond what is necessary and reasonable and do not preclude the possibility to determine the out-of-commerce status of a collection as a whole, when it is reasonable to presume that all works or other subject-matter in the collection are out of commerce.

5. Member States shall ensure that the licences referred to in paragraph 1 are sought from a collective management organisation that is representative for the Member State where:

    (a) the works or phonograms were first published or, in the absence of publication, where they were first broadcast, except for cinematographic and audiovisual works;

    (b) the producers of the works have their headquarters or habitual residence, for cinematographic and audiovisual works; or

    (c) the cultural heritage institution is established, when a Member State or a third country could not be determined, after proven efforts, according to points (a) and (b).

6. Licenses granted in accordance with paragraph 1 shall not apply to the works or other subject-matter of third country nationals except where points (a) and (b) of paragraph 5 apply.

7. Works or other subject-matter covered by a licence granted in accordance with paragraph 1 may be used by the cultural heritage institution in accordance with the terms of the licence in all Member States.

	Works or other subject-matter used in accordance with paragraph 2 may be used by the cultural heritage institution in all member states.

## Article 8 Objections to use and publicity

1. All rightholders may at any time object to their works or other subject-matter being deemed to be out of commerce and exclude the application of licences granted in accordance with article 7(1) or the exception adopted pursuant to article 7(2) their works or other subject-matter.

2. Member States shall provide that effective and verifiable publicity measures are taken regarding: 

    (a) the deeming of works or other subject-matter as out of commerce;
    
    (b) any license granted in accordance with article 7(1), and in particular its application to unrepresented rightholders;
    
    (c) any distribution, communication to the public or making available of works authorized by an exception adopted pursuant to article 7(2) 
    
    (d) the possibility of rightholders to object, referred to in paragraph 1; including for at least six months before the works or other subject-matter are distributed, communicated to the public or made available.

3. Member States shall ensure that information that allows the identification of the works or other subject-matter covered by a licence granted in accordance with Article 7 (1), use in line with an exception adopted pursuant to article 7(2) and information about the possibility of rightholders to object referred to in paragraph 1 are made publicly accessible in a single publicly accessible online portal for at least six months before the works or other subject-matter are distributed, communicated to the public or made available, and for the whole duration of the use.

4. The portal referred to in paragraph 2 shall be established and managed by the European Union Intellectual Property Office in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 386/2012.

5. The portal referred to in paragraph 2 shall allow authors and other rightholders to register objections referred to in paragraph 1 to uses on a per work or per rightsholder basis. The portal shall allow cultural heritage institutions to query all registered objections in pursuant to paragraph 1 and automatically inform them when information about a work or other subject matter that they add to the portal pursuant to the obligation established by paragraph 3 matches a registered objection. The portal shall allow authors and other rightholders to register search terms so that they are notified about any new entries in the portal that match these search terms.

	For visual, audiovisual and audio works the portal shall provide the possibility to publish preview files when adding information about works or other subject matter to the portal pursuant to the obligation established by paragraph 3. These preview files shall be used for the sole purpose of identifying such works or other subject matter.

## Article 9 Stakeholder dialogue

Member States shall ensure a regular dialogue between representative users' and rightholders' organisations, and any other relevant stakeholder organisations, to, on a sector-specific basis, foster the relevance and usability of the licensing mechanisms referred to in Article 7(1), the adequacy of the determinations made in accordance with Article 7(3), ensure the effectiveness of the safeguards for rightholders referred to in Article 8 notably as regards publicity measures, and, where applicable, assist in the establishment of the requirements referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 7(4).
