# CHAPTER 1a Measures to facilitate collective licensing

## Article 9a Collective licensing with an extended effect

1. Member States may provide, as far as the use within their national territory is concerned and subject to safeguards provided for in this Article, that when a collective management organisation, in accordance with its mandates from rightholders, enters into a licensing agreement for the exploitation of works or other subject-matter such an agreement may be extended to apply to the rights of rightholders who have not authorised the organisation to represent them by way of assignment, licence or any other contractual arrangement; or, with respect to such an agreement, the organisation has a legal mandate or is presumed to represent rightholders who have not authorised the organisation accordingly.

2. Member States shall ensure that the licensing mechanism referred to in paragraph 1 is only applied within well-defined areas of use where obtaining authorisations from rightholders on an individual basis is typically onerous and impractical to a degree that makes the required licensing transaction unlikely due to the nature of the use or of the types of works or other subject-matter concerned and that such mechanism safeguards the legitimate interests of rightholders.

3. The safeguards referred to in paragraph 1 must ensure that:

    (a) the organisation is, on the basis of mandates from rightholders, sufficiently representative of rightholders in the relevant type of works or other subject-matter and of the rights which are the subject of the licence for the relevant Member State;
  
    (b) equal treatment is guaranteed to all rightholders in relation to the terms of the licence; 
  
    (c)rightholders who have not authorised the organisation operating the licence may at any time easily and effectively exclude their works or other subject-matter from the licensing mechanism established in accordance with this Article;
  
    (d) appropriate publicity measures are taken to raise the awareness of rightholders regarding the possibility for organisations to license works or other subject-matter and the licensing taking place in accordance with this Article, and the possibilities of rightholders referred to in point (c) starting from a reasonable period before the works or other subject-matter are used under the licence. Publicity measures should be effective without the need to inform each rightholder individually.
  
4. The rules provided for in this Article are without prejudice to the application of collective licensing mechanisms with an extended effect in conformity with other provisions of Union law, including those which allow exceptions or limitations, and shall not apply to mandatory collective management of rights.

5. Where the law of a Member State provides for a licensing mechanism in accordance with this Article, the Member State concerned shall inform the Commission about the scope of that law, purposes and types of licences that may be introduced under that law as well as contact details for organisations issuing licences in accordance with the mechanism in paragraph 1. The Commission shall publish this information.

6. Based on the information received pursuant to paragraph 5 and on the discussions in the contact committee referred to in Article 12(3) of Directive 2001/29/EC, the Commission shall, by 31 December 2020, submit to the European Parliament and to the Council a report on the use of such mechanisms referred to in paragraph 1 in the EU and their impact on licensing and rightholders. The Commissionâ€™s report shall be accompanied, if appropriate, by a legislative proposal, including as regards the cross-border effect of such national schemes.
