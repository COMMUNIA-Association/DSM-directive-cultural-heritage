# CHAPTER 1a Measures to facilitate collective licensing

## Article 9a Collective licensing with an extended effect

1. Member States may provide, as far as the use within their national territory is concerned and subject to safeguards provided for in this Article, that when a collective management organisation to which Article 2 of Directive 2014/26/EU applies and which in accordance with its mandates from rightholders, enters into a licensing agreement for the exploitation of works or other subject-matter such an agreement may be extended to apply to the rights of rightholders who have not authorised that collective management organisation to represent them by way of assignment, licence or any other contractual arrangement; or, with respect to such an agreement, the organisation has a legal mandate or is presumed to represent rightholders who have not authorised the organisation accordingly.

2. Member States shall ensure that the licensing mechanism referred to in paragraph 1 is only applied within well-defined areas of use where obtaining authorisations from rightholders on an individual basis is typically onerous and impractical to a degree that makes the required licensing transaction unlikely due to the nature of the use or of the types of works or other subject-matter concerned and that such licensing mechanism safeguards the legitimate interests of rightholders.

3. The safeguards referred to in paragraph 1 shall provide that:

    (a) the collective right management organisation is, on the basis of mandates from rightholders, sufficiently representative of rightholders in the relevant type of works or other subject-matter and of the rights which are the subject of the licence for the relevant Member State;
  
    (b) equal treatment is guaranteed to all rightholders, including in relation to the terms of the licence;
  
    (c) rightholders who have not authorised the organisation operating the licence may at any time easily and effectively exclude their works or other subject-matter from the licensing mechanism established in accordance with this Article;
    
    (d) appropriate publicity measures are taken to inform rightholders regarding the possibility for the collective management organisation to license works or other subject-matter and the licensing taking place in accordance with this Article, and the possibilities of rightholders referred to in point (c) starting from a reasonable period before the works or other subject-matter are used under the licence. Publicity measures should be effective without the need to inform each rightholder individually.
    
4. This Article does not affect the application of collective licensing mechanisms with an extended effect in conformity with existing Union law, including provisions which allow exceptions or limitations.

    This article shall not apply to mandatory collective management of rights.
    
    Article 7 of Directive 2014/26/EU shall apply to the licensing mechanism provided for in this Article.

5. Where a Member State provides for a licensing mechanism in accordance with this Article, the Member State concerned shall inform the Commission about the scope of that law, purposes and types of licences that may be introduced under that law as well as contact details for organisations issuing licences in accordance with the mechanism in paragraph 1, and the way in which information on the licensing and the possibilities of rightholders referred to in point (c) of paragraph 3 can be obtained. The Commission shall publish this information.

6. Based on the information received pursuant to paragraph 5 and on the discussions in the contact committee referred to in Article 12(3) of Directive 2001/29/EC, the Commission shall, by 10 April 2021, submit to the European Parliament and to the Council a report on the use of such mechanisms referred to in paragraph 1 in the EU and their impact on licensing and rightholders, including right holders who are not members and/or who are nationals of, or resident in, another Member State and the impact on the internal market including the cross border provision of services and competition. The Commissionâ€™s report shall be accompanied, if appropriate, by a legislative proposal, including as regards the cross-border effect of such national schemes.
